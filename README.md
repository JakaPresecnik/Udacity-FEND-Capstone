# Udacity-FEND-Capstone
Capstone project for udacity's fend nanodegree
I started from scratch so I am making a temp readme to help me with steps I need to take to finish the project:

### Part 1:
- [x] Make a complete html file (including the part thet is not seen before submitting the form)
- [x] Create package.json file('npm init')
- [x] Build server (& install express, body-parser and cors)
- [x] Install webpack and babel
- [ ] Install html-webpack-plugin, webpack-dev-server and clean-webpack-plugin
- [ ] Install style-loader, node-sass, css-loader, sass-loader
- [ ] Create SASS and style the entire page

### Part 2:
- [ ] Make a jest '__test__' folder and work with that

# TRAVEL PLANER

## About
This is the final project for Udacity's Front end developer nanodegree. I had no starter code, the project was done from scratch.

The app gets the city entered by the user, and then sends the request to pixabay API and geonames API, from where it sends the required data to darkSkyWeb API and REST countries API. A window pops up and if the user wants to save the trip, all the required data is then send to server and UI is updated.

## How to use:

To run it clone the project, then opend a terminal and:
- `cd` into the folder of the project
- Run `npm i`
- Run` npm run start`,  This will start the server on your local computer...
- Then open another terminal, `cd` into the folder
- Run `npm run build-prod`
- And `npm run build-dev`
